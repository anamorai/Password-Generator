# Password Generator

I was required to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. My app runs in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. 

To complete this I will write a javascript code that will:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria
* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Installation

It will look like this:
